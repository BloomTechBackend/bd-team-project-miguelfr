# MiguelFr Reflection


## Design

* How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete?
  R: very closely, not much things changed.
* Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were
underway?
  R: No.

## Project

* How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user
  stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?
  R: I search for project ideas in the internet, participate in the project ideation workshop and followed the project examples.

* How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you
  employ to get yourself unblocked?
  R: I use the help of AI (Chat GPT and Barry) also searches on the internet.
* Did any of your commitments you made in your team charter help navigate a
  difficult decision, situation, or collaboration challenge? How?
  R: No. I did the project alone.

## Scrum

* What did you find to be the most valuable part of daily stand-ups? Is there
  anything you would want to do differently at stand-up to make it more useful
  to you?
  R: No. I did the project alone.
* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
  What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?
  R: Yes I underestimate, I learned that when we don't have experience with a technologie is very difficult to estimate the completion of the work.

## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How
  do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone,
  or your internship?
